# Looker Renew Template

This repository is a template for all Looker projects at Renew. It has a few key
features:
1. Integration with CI (at the time of writing: circleci)
2. Linting via [LAMS](https://looker-open-source.github.io/look-at-me-sideways/rules.html)
3. A base: view and model
4. developer.md and issues.md files which give feedback for liniting are not in the repo but will show up as commments in every PR after a push has been made.
This repo attempts to follow best practices as explained by [this article](https://discourse.looker.com/t/introducing-lams-a-lookml-style-guide-and-linter/10603)
